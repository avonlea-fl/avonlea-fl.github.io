# Avonlea at Smith Lake

## Welcome Home

Welcome to Avonlea, a majestic part of our county's pristine history. This land, rich in natural beauty and history, offers a serene environment where nature has been left unspoiled. From the arrowheads found in the shallows of Smith Lake to the ancient trees that populate the landscape, Avonlea is a testament to preservation.

Situated at one of the highest elevations in Marion county, the community descends gracefully to Smith Lake. The private access ensures solitude and peace, maintaining a sanctuary for all who call Avonlea home.
