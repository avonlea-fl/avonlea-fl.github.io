# Avonlea at Smith Lake

## Welcome Home

Welcome to Avonlea, a majestic part of our county's pristine history, where Mother Nature's creation has been left unspoiled for centuries. Our Native American forefathers roamed this land in pursuit of food, as evidenced by the arrowheads collected in the shallows of Smith Lake. Birds have populated the land with acorns, and for years, trees have grown uninterrupted.

The elevation of our land equals the highest point in the county, with the slope of the land descending to Smith Lake, where its private access limits any interruption of solitude and peace. It is our intent that this environment be preserved for those who elect to reside among nature's grandeur.

### Property Features

* **Lot Sizes:** The number of home sites is intentionally limited in order to maximize the quality of life and maintain the property's value for generations to come. The average size per lot is five acres, but this varies from slightly less than two acres to greater than eight acres.
* **Lake Access:** Access to the private lake is guaranteed with two common areas provided for all homeowners. This includes a dock and ramp, as well as a sandy beach.
* **Horses & Pets:** Horses are welcome at Avonlea, as specified in the deed restrictions. Ocala's beautiful terrain lends itself well to this addition. Avonlea can be home to both two and four-legged friends.

**Be one of the few to enjoy life at Avonlea....a finer way of living.**
